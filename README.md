# Genetics and Evolution Quiz

This is a dynamic and interactive quiz application built using Next.js. It allows users to test their knowledge of genetics and evolution by answering a series of questions related to DNA replication, transcription, and evolutionary concepts.

## Features
- **Interactive Quiz**: Multiple-choice questions with feedback after each answer.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Users receive points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect answers.
- **Progress Tracker**: Displays progress with completion percentage and question count.
- **Final Score**: At the end of the quiz, users can see their total score, accuracy, and a breakdown of correct and wrong answers.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and building the UI.
- **React**: For managing state and handling interactive components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and beautiful styling.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
